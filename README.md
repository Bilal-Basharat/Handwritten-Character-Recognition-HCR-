# Handwritten-Character-Recognition-HCR-
Recognition of handwritten characters plays a pivotal role in advancing human-computer interaction. The inherent vagueness and variability in individual writing styles and strokes pose challenges to the task. Moreover, dealing with the potential decline in source image quality adds complexity to the endeavor.

# Objective
1. It can be used to convert handwritten materials into digital text, improving accessibility
for individuals with visual impairments
2. Reduced man-power to convert old literature into digitized form manually.
3. The proposed system served as a guide and worked in character recognition areas.
4. Enriching the digitized library with the contents that have not been digitized.
5. It can aid educators by digitizing handwritten assignments and notes

# Data Collection
The project dataset is openly available on Kaggle (English Handwritten Characters) consisting
of around 3.4k image samples.

# Conclusion
A proposed handwritten character recognition system has been designed and tested. ANNs have
been trained for this purpose with various types of input samples and thatâ€™s why the developed
program has an ability to test and classify the input character into 52 different classes with an
accuracy of more than 90%.
Two different learning algorithms have been used. Scaled Conjugate Gradient algorithm has
been turned out to be better learning algorithm than the Resilient Back-propagation algorithm
in terms of accuracy and training time.
In future work, better classification methods will be investigated in order to minimize the miss
classified image.
